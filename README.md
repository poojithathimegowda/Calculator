# WPF Calculator

A simple and intuitive calculator application built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) in C#. This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, user interface design, and event handling in WPF.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Functionality**: Clear the current input or reset the entire calculation.
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Instant feedback as you enter numbers and operations.
- **Responsive UI**: The calculator interface is designed to be responsive and easy to use.

## Usage

1. **Enter numbers**:
    - Use the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers into the calculator.

2. **Perform operations**:
    - Select an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) after entering the first number, then enter the second number.

3. **Calculate**:
    - Press the `=` button to display the result of the calculation.

4. **Clear input**:
    - Use the `C` button to clear the current input or reset the entire calculation.

## Project Structure

- **MainWindow.xaml**: Contains the XAML markup for the user interface.
- **MainWindow.xaml.cs**: Contains the code-behind for handling user interactions and performing calculations.
- **App.xaml**: Defines application-wide resources and settings.
- **App.xaml.cs**: Contains the startup logic for the application.

## Supported Operations

- **Addition (`+`)**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divide one number by another.
